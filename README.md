# YouTube Videos: Data Analysis With Python (pandas)
 Supplementary Material for my [YouTube Videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZPLPOZkkjaTIDFjWmMWZZrsazv15z_J)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

`data/AC2021_AnnualisedEntryExit.xlsx` is taken straight from the [TfL website]( http://crowding.data.tfl.gov.uk/Annual%20Station%20Counts/2021/AC2021_AnnualisedEntryExit.xlsx). The first sheet in the file explains the contents: "The station entry / exit counts in this file represent the entry / exit or boarding / alighting count at each station on a typical weekday (Monday-Thursday), Friday, Saturday or Sunday, and annualised to an annual entry / exit total."

In the YouTube videos, we (1) perform the initial cleaning in Excel (2) save the file as a CSV file, and (3) load the CSV file using pandas.
In `Load_Excel_Data_In_Pandas.ipynb`, we avoid the use of MS Excel altogether and do all the initial steps in Python using the openpyxl library. 

`1 Data-Cleaning.ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook we use in the YouTube videos.
